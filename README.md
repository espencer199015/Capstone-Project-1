# Capstone-Project-1

## Overview
This project is part of my Springboard curriculum. It involves the design and development of a horse riding website, providing users with a platform for creating accounts, logging in and out, and selecting riding lessons for purchase. The project features a combination of technologies, including HTML, CSS, a Square API, Python for back-end development, and JavaScript for front-end development. It also integrates a SQL and PostgreSQL database to store user login and account information.
