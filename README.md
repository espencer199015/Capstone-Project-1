# Capstone-Project-1

## Overview
This project is part of my Springboard curriculum. It involves the design and development of a horse riding website, providing users with a platform for creating accounts, logging in and out, and selecting riding lessons for purchase. The project features a combination of technologies, including HTML, CSS, a Invoice Generator API, Python for back-end development, and JavaScript for front-end development. It also integrates a SQL and PostgreSQL database to store user login and account information.

## What the Website Does
The website offers a horse riding experience where users can create accounts, log in, select from a variety of riding lessons, select lessons, and manage their account information.

## Implemented Features and Why
1. **Signup and Login**: Users can create accounts to personalize their experience and log in to access their accounts. These features are essential for user identity and data tracking.
2. **Lesson Selection**: The website allows users to choose from various riding lesson types, enhancing the user's ability to select their desired experiences.
3. **Lesson Selection**: Users can select their desired lessons or remove them, giving them control over their choices.
4. **Account Management**: Users can edit their account information or delete their accounts, providing a way to manage their user profile.

## User Flow
1. **Signup**: A new user visits the website, clicks on the signup page, and creates an account with a username and password.
2. **Login**: The user logs in with their new account.
3. **Lesson Selection**: After logging in, the user navigates to the lessons page, selects their preferred lessons, and adds them to their account.
4. **Lesson Section**: The user can choose to select their desired lessons, which will be added to their account.
5. **Account Management**: Users can edit their account information or delete their account as needed.

## API
The invoice generator API is integrated into the website to enable lesson selection and download their lesson purchase bill. It provides a secure way for user to have proof of purchase for their selected lesson.
