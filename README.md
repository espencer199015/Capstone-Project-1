# Capstone-Project-1

## Overview
This project is part of my Springboard curriculum. It involves the design and development of a horse riding website, providing users with a platform for creating accounts, logging in and out, and selecting riding lessons for purchase. The project features a combination of technologies, including HTML, CSS, a Square API, Python for back-end development, and JavaScript for front-end development. It also integrates a SQL and PostgreSQL database to store user login and account information.

## Key Features
- HTML interface and CSS styling for an engaging user experience.
- Utilization of the Square API to enable users to choose and purchase riding lessons.
- Backend development using Python to manage account creation, login, and lesson selections.
- Front-end development with JavaScript to enhance user interactions.
- A SQL and PostgreSQL database to store and manage user account information.
- User functionality to sign up, log in and out, select and track lesson types.
- The ability for users to purchase or remove chosen lesson types from their accounts.
- Account management features, including user information editing and account deletion.
